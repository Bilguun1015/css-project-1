# CSS Projects

Revisiting CSS to deepen my knowledge and learn more tricks such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, transform and transitions.

## Notes

1.  Browser default `margin` is applied to `body` element.
2.  Margin Collapsing

- when adjacent elements have `margin` property, the bigger `margin` wins and overlaps the other block element's `margin`.
- when a parent element's firs/last/only child have `margin`, the bigger `margin` will win
- when there is an empty element without any other box model properties
