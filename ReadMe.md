# CSS Projects

Revisiting CSS to deepen my knowledge and learn more tricks such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, transform and transitions.

## Notes

1.  Browser default `margin` is applied to `body` element.
2.  Margin Collapsing

- when adjacent elements have `margin` property, the bigger `margin` wins and overlaps the other block element's `margin`.
- when a parent element's firs/last/only child have `margin`, the bigger `margin` will win
- when there is an empty element without any other box model properties

3. `pseudo`

- pseudo class -- `:class name` -- defines the style of a spceial state of an element
- pseudo element -- `::element name` -- defines the styel of a specific part of an element

4.  HTML class names

- BEM -- stand for Block, Element, Modifier -- is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. This methodology is easier for developers to update HTML and CSS. Makes the code dry and minimize side effects on updating CSS in the future.
